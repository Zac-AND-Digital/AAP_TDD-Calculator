# AAP_TDD-Calculator
AAP TDD Calculator

This project is created to fullfill the requirement of **E3: Application of Learning** in the AAP for the Testing Module.

Looking through the commit logs, it is visible that I implemented TDD by first creating tests that were designed to fail, as their corresponding concrete methods are yet to be implemented. Afterwards, I implement the methods in the concrete classes in such a way that the tests then pass.

To run the program for yourself, it's recommended to open the project in **JetBrains' IntelliJ IDE**. In there you can **right-click the Main class** and run `Main.main()` to use the program itself, or you can **right-click the test folder** and click `Run 'All Tests'`to run all the unit/widget tests. It **requires Java 17** to run, and you may have to head to `File -> Project Structure` to change the SDK to match your own environment!
